***TASKS***

We would like you to program a very small application using Java, Node.js and React.js. The deadline for completing the task and sending back is Monday, 10th July 23:59.

The task is the following:

Name: Random word generator

The project needs to do the following using Java, NodeJS and React technologies:

1) Java generates random words
2) React shows random words as requested
3) React requests nodejs to save random words
4) Nodejs saves random words into a MySQL database
5) React can request Java to see all random words saved in the database by Nodejs
6) React requests nodejs to form grammatically correct phrases with the random words

Hello,

Unfortunately, I couldn't finish all tasks because I don't have knowledge enough about word construction and NLP.
But I finished 5 from 6 tasks.

1) Java generates random words -- **NO**
2) React shows random words as requested - DONE
3) React requests nodejs to save random words - DONE
4) Nodejs saves random words into a MySQL database - DONE
5) React can request Java to see all random words saved in the database by Nodejs - DONE
6) React requests nodejs to form grammatically correct phrases with the random words - DONE

***RUN***

It's Necessary installing Mysql and create the database "luxysales" with user "luxysales" and password "luxysales".

Java:
I used the gradle instead of maven.
Install the gradle  - https://gradle.org/install/

To run, execute "gradle bootRun" in the command line.
The Spring boot is configured to run the server on the port 8081

Node + React:

To build, execute "npm install"
To run, execute "npm start"...
Access http://localhost:8080


There is a RandomWord.java class that I used as generator of Words. 
I'm not owner this class, I used because I couldn't implementing a good solution for the task.
The original source code is in https://github.com/maximeroussy/invitrode/blob/master/src/main/java/com.maximeroussy.invitrode/RandomWord.java
